    abstract = { Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence – the combination of symbolic methods with methods that are based on artificial neural networks – has a long-standing history. In this article, we provide a structured overview of current trends, by means of categorizing recent publications from key conferences. The article is meant to serve as a convenient starting point for research on the general topic. }
