method development for sampling from markov networks / bayesian networks

turn the recieved problem into a quantum algorithm
explore the scalability

continue on Jaro path -- map QUBO to HUBO and solve them 
include the beginning statement of course to have a bag  in which we include the q alg.


DATEV meeting

sum up the exponential family representations
-sample from them
-reformulte the energy tensor as HUBO
-solve it
-why is it better than sampling from than the Graphical models

HUBO/QUBO solutions and the tweaking of the program

Sampling programs




DATEV meeting 
represent the knowledge base as exponential families

sample from markov logic networks, by restricting to the hard formulas -- not to infer only the energies and calculate the highest but also the whole parameter space 
Markov logic networks with hard constraints == Bayesian networks with evidence

with markov networks we do not need any more evidence as we have hard constraints
we know the parameters so we need to do deductive reasoning -- deterministic computing as in sampling

generate a quantum circuit that encodes the logical knowledge base 



ESENTIALLY:
get knowledge bases/distributions
model them as tensor networks == exponnetial families
reshape them as quantum circuits, that encode the logic between the variables of the base data
sample from this quantum circuit with
